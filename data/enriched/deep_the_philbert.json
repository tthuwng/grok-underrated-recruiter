  "summary": "Philip Herron is an exceptional systems/compiler engineer with deep expertise demonstrated through leading the gccrs project, a ambitious alternative Rust compiler for GCC. His work shows outstanding technical depth and ownership on hard problems, but lacks any alignment with AI/AGI interests. Ideal for infrastructure-heavy roles requiring compiler/systems optimization skills.",

    "Deep compiler expertise (Rust type system, traits, MIR)",
    "Proven open-source leadership (gccrs maintainer)"
