  "project_evidence": {
    "score": 8,
    "evidence": "Live 24/7 deployments folding clothes handling long-tail cases with no downtime, pilots in SF Bay Area, extending infra for cloud robot foundation models, raised $21M seed, partnering hyperscalers for datacenter robots; no public GitHub repos found."
  },
  "mission_alignment": {
    "score": 9,
    "evidence": "Focused on intelligent robots via teleop data factories for foundation models, autonomous systems for datacenter/supercomputing infra to scale compute, frequent posts on dexterous manipulation, real-world AI robotics deployments."
  },
  "exceptional_ability": {
    "score": 9,
    "evidence": "Overcoming extreme teleop challenges (high loss/latency/bandwidth), 0 software downtime via Rust stack, custom hardware for high payload/force control, deployed pilots, co-founder backgrounds in low-latency trading and research."
  },
