  "reasoning": "Candidate has shipped Voxtral, MistralAI's first open-source audio LLMs with technical depth in on-policy DPO, continued pretraining, and custom evals like GSM8K-speech, demonstrating exceptional ability in building multimodal models. Strong evidence of hands-on work at top labs (Mistral, DeepMind) with mission alignment to advanced AI systems. Minor off-topic complaints but no major red flags; prioritizes shipping over hype.",
