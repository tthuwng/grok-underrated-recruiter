  "reasoning": "Candidate demonstrates exceptional ability through leading open-source projects like Cornserve (distributed serving for multimodal models), Cornstarch (multimodal training system), and Perseus/Zeus (energy optimization for ML training), with NeurIPS tutorial on ML power/energy. Shows deep technical depth in systems for DL infra, handling multimodality challenges, model fission, and energy bloat with code/papers. Strong mission alignment with xAI via focus on efficient training/serving for advanced models, ownership as co-lead, and clear communication.",
