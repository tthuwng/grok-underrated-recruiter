As Head of TRAE at ByteDance, there may be leadership in AI products, but nothing demonstrates exceptional hands-on ability, ownership of hard problems, or technical depth required for xAI. Lacks any discussion of core tech stacks like JAX, CUDA, or transformers training, and shows no mission alignment beyond generic AI tools.",
