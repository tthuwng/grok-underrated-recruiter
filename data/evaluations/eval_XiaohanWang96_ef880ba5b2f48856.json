  "reasoning": "Candidate demonstrates exceptional ability through releasing open-source SOTA video-LMMs (Apollo family), benchmarks (SciVideoBench, TimeScope, ApolloBench), and frameworks like TPO, showing hands-on building in multimodal ML. Technical depth evident in specifics like long-context needle-in-haystack evals, temporal grounding, and agentic workflows for video reasoning, aligning with xAI's focus on reasoning and foundation models. Strong mission fit via science-oriented video understanding (physics/chemistry), though more research than core infra engineering.",
