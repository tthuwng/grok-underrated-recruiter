No deep technical discussions, open-source contributions, or work aligning with xAI's core stack (e.g., CUDA, JAX, distributed systems) or mission of understanding the universe. Focus is on content creation, vibe coding, and promotion rather than shipping substantial products or demonstrating ownership of complex systems.",
