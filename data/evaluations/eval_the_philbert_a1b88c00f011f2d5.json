  "reasoning": "Candidate is lead maintainer of GCC Rust, demonstrating exceptional ability through hands-on implementation of advanced features like impl Trait (APIT/RPIT), const generics, fn traits, macros, and type systems, with blog posts, talks, and full-time development commitment. Deep technical depth in compiler development, Rust internals, and systems programming aligns well with xAI's Rust/C++/infrastructure stack, showing ownership of hard problems. Strong mission fit via obsession with building high-performance systems tools, though not directly ML-focused.",
