  "reasoning": "Candidate demonstrates exceptional ability through multiple top-conference publications (NeurIPS, ACL) on agentic self-improvement (TT-SI, ToolRL) and evaluation frameworks (TD-Eval), with code releases and leaderboards showing hands-on building. Technical depth evident in detailed findings on uncertainty-guided adaptation, ablations, and RL methods, aligning with xAI's focus on LLMs, reasoning, and optimization. Strong mission fit in self-evolving agents and agentic learning, though more academic than production-scale engineering.",
