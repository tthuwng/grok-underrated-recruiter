  "reasoning": "Candidate demonstrates solid academic research in robotics with ROSETTA (best paper award, code released) and BEHAVIOR benchmark, showing evidence of building and shipping in RL/reward modeling. However, all work is robotics-focused with no signs of large-scale ML training, transformers, scaling, or xAI's core stack like JAX/CUDA/distributed systems. Mission misalignment: obsessed with household robots and embodied AI, not foundational AI for understanding the universe.",
