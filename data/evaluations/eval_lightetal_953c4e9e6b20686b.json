Technical depth is evident in detailed explanations of adaptive decomposition, plug-and-play integration with models like Llama/Mistral, and standardized evals without retraining. Strong mission alignment with LLM reasoning/agents and ownership via code release and poster presentations, though collaborative academic context slightly tempers solo ownership.",
