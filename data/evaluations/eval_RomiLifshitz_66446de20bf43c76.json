  "reasoning": "Candidate demonstrates solid research in quantum information theory, including original work on non-local games for detecting entanglement in noisy quantum devices, with clear ownership via thesis and publications. However, no evidence of building or shipping software/products in xAI's core ML/AI stack (e.g., transformers, JAX, distributed training); focus is purely quantum computing, not aligned with scaling AI systems. Lacks mission obsession for classical AI/LLM advancements beyond casual mentions of ChatGPT.",
