  "reasoning": "Candidate shows evidence of building through open-sourced code for multimodal action-conditioned video prediction presented at ICCV 2025, with deep technical discussions on evolution strategies, LoRA ranks, and multiway cross-attention indicating real understanding beyond buzzwords. Work on world models and reasoning aligns moderately with xAI's mission of understanding the universe, though more vision/robotics-focused; heavy collaboration as a PhD student tempers ownership but top-conference outputs suggest exceptional ability. Communication is clear and concise in sharing research.",
