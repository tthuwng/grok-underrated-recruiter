  "reasoning": "Candidate demonstrates exceptional ability through leading the development of RedTeamCUA, a sophisticated adversarial testing framework built on OSWorld, with detailed benchmarks (RTC-Bench) and empirical results on CUAs/prompt injection, evidenced by ICLR 2025 spotlight acceptances. Shows deep technical depth in agent safety, alignment, and evals via specific metrics (ASR/AR) and threat models, aligning somewhat with xAI's reasoning/ML interests though more safety-focused. Clear ownership in joint projects with academic output, but lacks production shipping or core xAI stack (e.g., JAX/CUDA).",
