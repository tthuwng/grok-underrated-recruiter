  "reasoning": "Candidate demonstrates exceptional ability through multiple top-tier ML conference publications (NeurIPS, EMNLP, COLING) and shipping research artifacts like benchmarks (UserBench, CRMArena, APIGen-MT-5k) and frameworks (LoRA Soups, APIGen-MT), showing deep technical work in LLM agents, reasoning, and post-training. Technical depth is evident in detailed threads on CoT analysis, LoRA merging experiments, and probabilistic reasoning effects, beyond buzzwords. Strong mission alignment with LLM reasoning/evals, though some enterprise focus; clear ownership via presentations and leadership in threads.",
