However, work is primarily in web/Node.js/IDE space with surface-level AI model integration, lacking depth in xAI-relevant areas like ML training, distributed systems, or core stack (Rust/C++/CUDA/JAX). Tweets are mostly promotional updates rather than evidence of solving hard, mission-critical AI problems.",
