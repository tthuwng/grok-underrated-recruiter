  "reasoning": "No clear evidence of personally building or shipping exceptional technical work; tweets mostly promote Tesla products and mention 'we' for company AI integrations without personal ownership or depth. Lacks demonstration of deep technical skills in xAI-relevant areas like ML training, distributed systems, or core stack; older tweets show minor infra tweaks like IPv6 but nothing rigorous. Mission alignment is tangential via Tesla AI in service/support, not core AI understanding of the universe.",
