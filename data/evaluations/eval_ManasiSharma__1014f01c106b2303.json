  "reasoning": "Candidate demonstrates strong evidence of building impactful ML evaluation tools like ResearchRubrics, a human-authored benchmark with code release, dataset, and arXiv paper, showing technical depth in agent reasoning evals, LLM-as-judge, and complexity frameworks. Mission alignment is excellent with focus on frontier model reasoning, agents, and RL, matching xAI's goals, though ownership is shared in a large team context. Communication is clear and substantive, with low follower count but high-quality shipping over hype.",
