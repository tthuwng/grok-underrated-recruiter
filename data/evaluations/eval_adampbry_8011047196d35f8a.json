However, no evidence of personal hands-on exceptional engineering work, deep technical depth (e.g., code, ML optimizations, or xAI-relevant stack like JAX/CUDA), or focus on LLMs/reasoning; tweets are primarily promotional and high-level company announcements crediting teams. Lacks direct alignment with xAI's core AI mission and engineering roles.",
