  "reasoning": "Candidate shows evidence of building ML training platforms from scratch and contributing to visual intelligence models like Flux.1 Kontext at bfl_ml and LaminiAI, with specific mentions of CUDA, large-scale hardware (1.5TB HBM, 20.9 PFLOPs), and features like guaranteed JSON outputs. Aligns with xAI's ML infra needs but lacks deep technical breakdowns, code, or open-source proof; mostly promotional rather than personal exceptional demos.",
