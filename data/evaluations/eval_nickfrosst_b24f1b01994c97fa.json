Tweets demonstrate technical depth in model specialization, reasoning-tool use decoupling, and enterprise deployment, aligning with xAI's stack (transformers, training optimizations). While ownership is team-attributed rather than personal code/ships, leadership in building competitive AI systems shows mission obsession and initiative over careerism.",
