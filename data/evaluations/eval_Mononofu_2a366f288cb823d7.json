  "relevant": true,
  "score": 0.95,
  "reasoning": "This candidate has clear evidence of exceptional ability through direct contributions to groundbreaking DeepMind projects like AlphaProof (IMO silver-medalist AI), AlphaTensor (novel matrix multiplication algorithms published in Nature), MuZero, and AlphaCode, demonstrating deep ownership of hard RL and reasoning problems. Technical depth is evident in personal blog summaries, integrations of AlphaZero with LLMs and theorem provers, aligning strongly with xAI's focus on advanced AI for understanding complex systems. Mission fit is excellent with excitement for AI accelerating science, though current role at Anthropic is a minor note.",
