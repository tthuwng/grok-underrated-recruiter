  "reasoning": "No evidence of personal exceptional technical work, building, or shipping code/products; tweets are purely promotional for Palantir events, AIP platform, and fellowships without any original technical contributions or deep dives. Lacks demonstration of hands-on engineering, deep ML expertise, or mission-aligned obsession with core AI problems like training/inference. Position in commercial/AIP leadership suggests sales/marketing focus rather than engineering ownership.",
