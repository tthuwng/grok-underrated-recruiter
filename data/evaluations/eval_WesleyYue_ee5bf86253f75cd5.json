  "reasoning": "Bio indicates building coding assistants at a YC W23 startup and prior roles at elite robotics firms like KittyHawk and Waymo, suggesting potential exceptional ability, but tweets provide no concrete evidence of shipped products, open-source contributions, or deep technical work. Content is mostly memes, casual opinions, and surface-level AI commentary without code, math, experiments, or ownership of hard problems. Lacks mission obsession with xAI-scale challenges like training/inference optimization; high noise-to-signal ratio.",
