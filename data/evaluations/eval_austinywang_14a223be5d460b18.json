However, content is heavily promotional with no evidence of deep technical work in xAI-relevant areas like ML training, transformers, distributed systems, or core infrastructure; early tweets reveal beginner-level web dev projects lacking exceptional depth. No mission alignment with understanding the universe or hardcore AI systems, focusing instead on no-code tools and productivity apps.",
