  "reasoning": "Candidate demonstrates exceptional ability through multiple peer-reviewed papers at top conferences (ICML, ICLR, EMNLP, ACL) on LLM inference scaling, reasoning strategies, and security benchmarks, with open-source code releases showing hands-on building. Technical depth is evident in rigorous evaluations of methods like CoT, self-consistency, and Mixture of Agents, backed by experiments on reasoning vs. non-reasoning models. Strong mission alignment with xAI's focus on advanced AI via LLM evals and optimization, plus clear ownership from internship work at Together AI.",
