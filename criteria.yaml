# xAI Candidate Evaluation Criteria
# Based on actual xAI job postings + Elon Musk's hiring philosophy

company_context: |
  xAI's mission is to create AI systems that can accurately understand the universe
  and aid humanity in its pursuit of knowledge.

  Culture:
  - Small, highly motivated team focused on engineering excellence
  - Flat organizational structure - all employees hands-on
  - Leadership given to those who show initiative and consistently deliver excellence
  - Strong work ethic and prioritization skills
  - All engineers expected to have strong communication skills

  Musk's Core Filter:
  - "Evidence of exceptional ability" is the only non-negotiable
  - Deep ownership of hard problems (not on the periphery)
  - Extreme drive & willingness to work intensely for the mission
  - Mission obsession over careerist polish
  - Track record of solving hard problems, not degrees

# The key question xAI asks every candidate:
key_question: "What exceptional work have you done?"
